# Clawr  
The first iOS app for OpenClaw — create, import, and manage AI agents directly from your mobile device.

---

## Overview

Clawr is a native iOS client built specifically for OpenClaw agents.

It provides a secure mobile interface for pairing with, configuring, monitoring, and approving actions from OpenClaw agents running on desktop or in the cloud.

This repository contains the iOS application layer only. It does not include the OpenClaw agent runtime.

---

## Architecture

```
iOS App (SwiftUI)
        │
        ▼
API Layer (REST + WebSocket)
        │
        ▼
OpenClaw Agent Runtime (Desktop / Cloud)
        │
        ▼
External Integrations (Twitter, Slack, Gmail, Wallets, etc.)
```

### Communication Model

- REST APIs for deterministic state synchronization  
- WebSockets for real-time updates  
- APNs for push notifications  
- Token-based authentication for secure sessions  

---

## Core Features

- Pair with existing OpenClaw desktop agents  
- Create new cloud-hosted agents  
- Monitor agent lifecycle state  
- Approve or reject agent actions  
- View execution logs and task history  
- Manage integrations and wallet permissions  
- Real-time push notifications  

Clawr does not execute agents locally. It acts purely as a control interface.

---

## How Pairing Works

1. OpenClaw runtime generates a pairing session.
2. User enters pairing code in Clawr.
3. Secure token exchange occurs.
4. Agent ID is mapped to the device.
5. Session credentials are stored in iOS Keychain.
6. State synchronization begins.

After pairing, all communication is authenticated and scoped to the registered agent.

---

# OpenClaw Desktop Setup

To use Clawr, you must run an OpenClaw agent locally or remotely.

## Requirements

- macOS, Linux, or Windows  
- Node.js 18+  
- Git  

---

## 1. Clone OpenClaw

```
git clone https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw.git
cd openclaw
```

---

## 2. Install Dependencies

```
npm install
```

or

```
yarn install
```

---

## 3. Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```
OPENCLAW_API_PORT=3000
OPENCLAW_SECRET=your_secret_key
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_key
```

---

## 4. Start the Agent Runtime

```
npm run dev
```

or

```
npm start
```

The agent should now be running at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

---

## Pairing From Mobile

1. Launch Clawr on iOS.
2. Tap “Import Existing Agent”.
3. Enter the pairing code generated by the desktop runtime.
4. Confirm the session.
5. Agent state synchronization begins automatically.

If testing locally:

- Ensure your iPhone and desktop are on the same network.
- Allow inbound connections on the configured port.
- Verify the API endpoint is reachable.

---

## Running Clawr Locally

### Requirements

- macOS  
- Xcode 15+  
- iOS 17+ SDK  

### Setup

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/clawr.git
```

2. Open `Clawr.xcodeproj` in Xcode.

3. Configure environment variables:
   - Backend base URL
   - Supabase credentials
   - Agent API endpoint

4. Build and run on simulator or device.

---

## Security Considerations

- All API calls are authenticated
- Session tokens are stored securely in iOS Keychain
- Approval flows require explicit user interaction
- Wallet operations are permission-scoped
- No private keys are exposed in the UI layer

---

## Repository Scope

This repository includes:

- iOS frontend
- Networking layer
- Agent state management
- Pairing flow
- Push notification handling

This repository does NOT include:

- OpenClaw agent runtime
- Desktop execution engine
- Core agent orchestration logic

---

## Vision

Clawr is designed to be the standard mobile interface for OpenClaw agents, enabling persistent, real-time AI automation with secure human oversight.
