# Clawr
The first iOS app for OpenClaw — create, import, and manage AI agents directly from your mobile device.

---

## Overview

Clawr is the first dedicated iOS application built for OpenClaw. It extends the power of OpenClaw desktop agents to mobile, allowing users to create new agents, import existing ones, manage workflows, and receive real-time updates — all from their iPhone.

Clawr is designed to make OpenClaw agents more accessible, more manageable, and ready for mainstream adoption.

## Core Features

- Mobile creation and configuration of OpenClaw agents
- Import and manage existing desktop agents
- Real-time notifications for approvals and task completion
- Secure pairing between desktop agents and mobile app
- Clean, premium dark-themed iOS interface
- Support for multiple integrations and wallet-enabled agents

---

## How It Works

Clawr securely pairs with an OpenClaw desktop agent or cloud-hosted agent instance. Once connected:

- Agent states are synchronized via secure APIs
- Tasks can be assigned and monitored from mobile
- Real-time notifications are delivered when actions require approval or when tasks are completed
- Users maintain full control over their agents and integrations

Clawr acts as a true companion application, bridging desktop agent orchestration with mobile accessibility.

## Vision

Clawr is built to be the standard mobile interface for OpenClaw agents. By combining intuitive design with powerful agent control, it enables developers and power users to operate AI agents seamlessly from anywhere.
